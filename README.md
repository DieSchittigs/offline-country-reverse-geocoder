Essentially a PHP fork of https://github.com/bencampion/reverse-country-code

##Dataset

This library uses the world borders dataset from [thematicmapping.org](http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php). The data is stored in a properties file within the jar file that maps country codes to Well Known Text format polygons and multi-polygons. The dataset was converted to Well Known Text format by [GIS Stack Exchange user, elrobis](http://gis.stackexchange.com/a/17441).
